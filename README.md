## This project applies the Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM) to solve a transportation problem for a manufacturing company facing logistics challenges. The analysis determines the most cost-effective transportation partner by comparing two logistics providers with different cost structures and service capabilities. The solution is verified using the Modified Distribution (MODI) Method to confirm optimality, and additional perspectives on Sensitivity analysis are provided to enhance decision-making.


# Introduction to the Business Case
## Company Background
Bulia Traders, a family-owned business operated by Keshav's family, is a well-established manufacturer of industrial goods. The company runs production facilities in three towns across Rajasthan—Bhilwara, Jaipur, and Jodhpur—and exports its products globally via maritime shipping from four port terminals: P1, P2, P3, and P4
## Current Operational Challenge
The presented operational challenge is inspired from real scenario from Keshav Bulia’s family business. Bulid traders traditionally works with TransLogic, a transportation service provider that handles the movement of goods from manufacturing plants to port terminals. During the monsoon season, which accounts for approximately 40% of Bulia Traders 's annual revenue, TransLogic has restricted operations due to adverse weather conditions, declining to service port terminal P4 and limiting their services to ports P1, P2, and P3 only.
As a consequence, Bulia Traders  needs to redistribute the goods originally destined for P4, allocating one-third of this volume to each of the remaining three port terminals (P1, P2, and P3).
Upon learning about this situation, GlobalFreight, a competing transportation company, has approached Bulia Traders  with an offer to service all four port terminals without restrictions. However, their pricing structure differs from TransLogic's, with some routes priced higher and others lower. GlobalFreight requires exclusivity and will not allow Bulia Traders  to split transportation between both providers.
Bulia Traders 's Operations Department, led by two analysts Keshav Bulia and Dev Kumar Acharya with optimization expertise, must determine which transportation partner will minimize costs while maintaining full service capability.
